        </p>

        <p>
            Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. 
            These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

        <h2>1. Use of Service</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Informational Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            Exchange Rate Tracker provides real-time exchange rate information for informational purposes only.

            of accuracy or completeness.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 No Financial Advice</h3>
        <p>
            The Service does not provide financial, investment, or trading advice. Exchange rates shown in the app 
            are for reference only and should not be used as the sole basis for any financial decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 No Account Required</h3>

            The Service does not require you to create an account. You can use the app immediately without any

            financial institutions.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Delays and Interruptions</h3>
        <p>
            Exchange rate data may be delayed or interrupted due to technical issues, network problems, or third-party
