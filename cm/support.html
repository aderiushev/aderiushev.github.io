                Download the Control Manager app from the App Store, tap "Sign Up", and enter your email address
                and password. You'll receive a verification email to confirm your account. Click the link in the
                email to verify and start organizing your tasks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">

                Yes! Control Manager is free to download and use. Anyone can create an account and start managing
                their personal tasks, projects, and to-do lists right away.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Who is Control Manager for?</h3>
            <p>
                Control Manager is for anyone who wants to stay organized and productive. Whether you're managing
                personal goals, household tasks, shopping lists, study projects, or coordinating with friends and
                family, Control Manager helps you get things done. It's perfect for students, professionals,
                homemakers, or anyone looking to organize their daily life.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Using the App</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I create a task?</h3>
            <p>
                From the "My Tasks" screen, tap the "New Task" button at the bottom. Enter the task details,
                including title, description, and due date. You can keep it for yourself or optionally share it
                with someone else. Tap "Save" to create the task.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are the different task views?</h3>
            <p>
                Control Manager offers three main views to help you stay organized:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>My Tasks:</strong> Your personal tasks that you haven't shared with anyone</li>
                <li><strong>All Tasks:</strong> All your tasks, including shared ones</li>
                <li><strong>Assigned to Me:</strong> Tasks that others have shared with you</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I track time on tasks?</h3>
            <p>
                Open a task and tap the "Time Log" button. You can add time entries to track how much time you've
                spent on the task. This is great for understanding your productivity, tracking study time, or
                monitoring how long projects take.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I use Control Manager offline?</h3>
            <p>
                You can view your existing tasks offline, but you'll need an internet connection to create new tasks,
                update existing ones, or sync changes across your devices.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Sharing & Collaboration</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I share tasks with others?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! You can optionally share tasks or projects with friends, family members, roommates, or colleagues.
                This is great for coordinating household chores, planning events together, or working on group projects.
                You control what you share and with whom.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I share a task with someone?</h3>
            <p>
                When creating or editing a task, tap the "Share with" field and enter the email address of the person
                you want to share with. They'll receive a notification and the task will appear in their "Assigned to Me"
                view. You can share with anyone who has a Control Manager account.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I have to share my tasks?</h3>
            <p>
                No! Sharing is completely optional. You can use Control Manager entirely for your personal tasks and
                never share anything with anyone. It's your choice.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Organization & Productivity</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I organize tasks into projects?</h3>
            <p>
                When creating or editing a task, tap the "Project" field and either select an existing project
                or create a new one. Projects help you group related tasks together - like "Home Renovation",
                "Vacation Planning", "Study Goals", or "Fitness Journey".
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
