        <div class="faq-item">

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>My Tasks:</strong> Tasks you created that haven't been assigned yet</li>

                <li><strong>Assigned to Me:</strong> Tasks that have been assigned to you by team members</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
