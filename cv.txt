As a person
I would believe that I'm the one who easily gets new people, projects - being cheerful and proactive. I’m not that concerned about the legacy code, damned project etc. Over the years I have come to think more from the business perspective, not being that idealistic but instead really being passionate about bringing the target value, moving forward and developing myself, surrounding colleagues, business.
I might be quite a demanding person sometime, but I always(!) start with myself.
