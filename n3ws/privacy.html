        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 26, 2024</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how N3ws ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares
            information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting
            your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 News Content</h3>
        <p>
            The App retrieves news headlines from third-party sources via the Perplexity AI API.
            This content is cached locally on your device for performance optimization.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>
            We store the following data locally on your device using AsyncStorage:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cached news headlines (refreshed every 5 minutes)</li>
            <li>Timestamp of last news fetch</li>
            <li>App preferences and settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
            We may automatically collect certain technical information, including:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>App version and usage statistics</li>
            <li>Error logs and crash reports (to improve app stability)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide Core Functionality:</strong> To fetch, cache, and display news headlines</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Performance:</strong> To optimize caching and reduce API calls</li>
            <li><strong>Improve the App:</strong> To analyze usage patterns, fix bugs, and enhance user experience</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To respond to your support requests and provide customer service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>
            All data is stored locally on your device using React Native's AsyncStorage.
            We do not maintain any servers or databases that store your personal information.
        </p>

        <p>
            News content is cached temporarily and automatically refreshed every 5 minutes.
            You can clear this cache at any time by reinstalling the app.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>We use the following third-party services that may collect information:</p>

        <h3>4.1 Perplexity AI</h3>
