        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is N3ws?</h3>
            <p>
                N3ws is a minimalist news app that delivers the latest headlines in exactly 3 words.
                We use AI to distill news stories from Russia, Spain, and around the world into
                ultra-concise summaries, helping you stay informed without information overload.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often does the news update?</h3>
            <p>
                News is refreshed every 5 minutes. The app uses smart caching to minimize data usage
                and API calls. When you open the app, you'll see a countdown timer showing when fresh
                news will be available. You can tap the "+3" button to manually refresh when new
                content is ready.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What languages are supported?</h3>
            <p>
                N3ws provides news in three languages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Russian</strong> - News from Russia in Russian</li>
                <li><strong>Spanish</strong> - News from Spain in Spanish</li>
                <li><strong>English</strong> - World news in English</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why only 3 words?</h3>
            <p>
                Three words is the perfect balance between brevity and meaning. It forces the AI
                to capture the absolute essence of each story, cutting through clickbait and fluff.
                You can scan dozens of headlines in seconds, then tap any that interest you to read
                the full article from the source.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I read the full article?</h3>
            <p>
                Tap on any 3-word headline to open the full article from the original news source
                in your browser. Each headline links directly to the source article, so you can
                dive deeper into stories that catch your attention.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I refresh the news?</h3>
            <p>
                Simply tap the button at the bottom of the screen. If fresh news is available,
                you'll see a "+3" button. If the cache is still fresh, you'll see a countdown
                timer showing when new content will be ready. The app prevents unnecessary refreshes
                to save data and API costs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does N3ws require an account?</h3>
            <p>
                No! N3ws is completely anonymous. You don't need to create an account, provide
                an email, or sign in. Just download the app and start reading news immediately.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is N3ws free?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, N3ws is completely free to download and use. There are no in-app purchases,
                subscriptions, or ads.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How accurate are the 3-word headlines?</h3>
            <p>
                The headlines are generated by Perplexity AI, which analyzes current news stories
                and creates intelligent summaries. While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated
                summaries may not capture every nuance of a story. Always tap through to read
                the full article for complete context.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What data does N3ws collect?</h3>
            <p>
                Very little! N3ws stores news headlines locally on your device for caching purposes.
                We don't collect personal information, track your reading habits, or require accounts.
                See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.

                N3ws is currently available for iOS. Android support may be added in the future.
            </p>
