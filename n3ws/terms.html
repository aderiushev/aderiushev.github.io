        <p>
            Welcome to N3ws. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the N3ws mobile
            application (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be
            bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <p>
            By accessing or using N3ws, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree

            the App.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>

        <p>
            N3ws is a news aggregation application that provides ultra-concise 3-word headlines
            from various news sources. The App uses artificial intelligence (Perplexity AI) to
            generate summaries of current news stories across three categories: Russia, Spain,
            and World.
        </p>

        <p>
            The App is provided free of charge and does not require user registration or accounts.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 License</h3>
        <p>

            news stories or original articles.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 3-word summaries are generated by AI and are provided for informational purposes
            only. They are not intended to replace reading the full articles from original sources.
        </p>
