        <p>
            Welcome to Palabrino Support! Here you'll find answers to common questions and information 
            on how to get the most out of your language learning experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is Palabrino?</h3>
            <p>
                Palabrino is a Spanish vocabulary learning app that uses visual association to help you 
                memorize words. You'll see a Spanish word and choose the matching image from four options. 
                It's a fun, gamified way to build your vocabulary!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How does the streak system work?</h3>
            <p>
                Your streak increases by one each time you select the correct image. If you choose the 
                wrong image, your streak resets to zero. The app tracks both your current streak and 
                your longest streak ever, so you can challenge yourself to beat your personal best!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens when I select the wrong answer?</h3>
            <p>
                When you select an incorrect image, the app will show you the correct answer along with 
                translations in English and Russian. This helps you learn from your mistakes and remember 
                the word better next time.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I use the hint feature?</h3>
            <p>
                If you're stuck on a word, tap the hint button (usually displayed near the Spanish word). 
                This will show you translations in English and Russian to help you understand the meaning 
                without breaking your learning flow.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my progress saved?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! Your game progress, including your current streak and longest streak, is automatically 
                saved both locally on your device and in the cloud (if you're signed in). This means you 
                can continue your learning journey across multiple devices.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need an internet connection to use Palabrino?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, an internet connection is required to load images and translations. The app fetches 
                fresh content for each round to provide you with a diverse learning experience.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What languages are supported for translations?</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, Palabrino provides translations from Spanish to English and Russian. This makes 
                it perfect for English and Russian speakers who want to learn Spanish vocabulary.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How can I reset my progress?</h3>
            <p>
                Your streak automatically resets when you select a wrong answer. If you want to completely 
                reset your account data, please contact support at 
                <a href="mailto:derushev.aleksei@gmail.com">derushev.aleksei@gmail.com</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is Palabrino free to use?</h3>

                learning accessible to everyone.

                App Store or Google Play Store.

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>The app is not loading images</h3>
            <p>
                If images aren't loading, please check your internet connection. If the problem persists, 
                try closing and reopening the app. If you continue to experience issues, please contact 
                support with details about your device and the problem.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>My streak was lost</h3>
            <p>
                Your streak resets to zero when you select an incorrect answer - this is by design. However, 
                your longest streak is always preserved. If you believe your longest streak was incorrectly 
                reset, please contact support.
            </p>
        </div>
